# Rimworld Code Snippets
If you are looking for a bit of code to do a common task in a Rimworld mod, this is the place to find it.
If something you are looking for is not here, please ask on the modder's Discord channel- your problem may have already been solved.

Please feel free to contribute code that others may find useful- this includes, but is not limited to:
- Injection code
- Custom defs
- Debugging utilities
- Harmony patches

All newly added items must be tagged with the Rimworld version they were written for. E.g.: `Inject Designator (A17).cs`
Please include a description, and a few words on how to use the provided code.
If your snippet has any dependencies other than the stock game, please list them and their versions.

It is recommended not to publish entire mods in this repository- snippets should be easy to browse and have a specific use case.

If you have multiple files, please put them in a separate folder.
